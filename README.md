# Blog

A curated blog website with all my readings!

# Why Blog?

I wanted to have more control over my writing. I usually spend weeks to months writing a detailed blog and explaining it like a child! It reflects the knowledge and learning that I have acquired over a period of time. I have always wanted to improve my communication skills!

# Best Practices

I have choose Astro over ReactJS and NextJS as articles are just bunch of static pages. With this, I have made sure to follow best practices and have met all the SEO requirements!
